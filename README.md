# Welcome to My Mobapp Studio
***

## Task
The task here was to analyze data scraped from the Google Play Store 
in terms of genres, categories, price, popularity, etc. 

## Description
The challenge was solved by reading a csv file with the app data using 
pandas read_csv() and carrying out basic data science operations to 
reveal features of the data that provided insight into the popularity 
and prices of applications by genre, category, etc. Basic data  visualization 
and analysis carried out all involved pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. A blog 
post summarizing the results of the analysis was completed, the link to which 
can be found in link_to_blog_post.txt. 

## Installation
A standard Jupyter notebook with python 3 installation is requried, along 
with pandas, matplotlib, and numpy. 

## Usage
The dataset googleplaystore.csv must first be downloaded from:
